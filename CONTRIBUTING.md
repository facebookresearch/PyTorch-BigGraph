## Our Development Process

This project's source-of-truth is the version in Facebook's internal codebase,
which is continuously synced with the GitHub mirror using
[ShipIt](https://github.com/facebook/fbshipit). Pull requests on GitHub are
copied over using ImportIt (a companion tool for ShipIt).

5. Make sure your code lints.
